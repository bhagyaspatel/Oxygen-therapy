# Oxygen-therapy
The app which helps emergency staff ward who provides oxygen therapies to the patients in different hospitals.
Using this the hospital ward can call for the emergancy oxygen therapy within the click of a button whose notification alert will be passed to the doctors 
serving the patient.

I have used Firebase push notification for alert messaging and firebase database along with MVVM architecture.
